# Postman API Laboratory

This repository serves as a personal laboratory and learning space for exploring and mastering API testing with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to document the learning process of Postman, from basic requests to advanced features like authentication, automated testing, and collaboration. It acts as a hands-on environment for experimenting with different APIs and testing methodologies. This project is a core part of my journey to learn Quality Assurance and software testing principles.

## Contents

This repository contains the following key files:

*   `postman learning.md`: A detailed journal tracking the learning journey, including concepts, practical examples, and code snippets for various Postman features.
*   `index.html`: A web-based dashboard to visualize and track learning progress.
*   `UI_Improvements_TODO.md`: A to-do list for planned improvements to the project's user interface.
*   `assets/`: A directory for storing supporting assets like images or stylesheets for the dashboard.

## Learning Journey Highlights

The `postman learning.md` file covers a wide range of topics, including:

*   Making basic `GET` and `POST` requests.
*   Organizing work with Collections and Environments.
*   Understanding and implementing various API authentication methods (API Keys, Basic Auth, Bearer Tokens).
*   Writing API tests using JavaScript to validate responses.
*   A practical example of testing the OpenWeatherMap API.

This project is an active learning environment and is continuously updated as new concepts are explored.
