# UI Improvements To-Do List for Postman-API-Laboratory Dashboard

This document outlines planned visual and interactive enhancements for the dashboard.

## 1. Data Integration & Accuracy

*   [ ] **Dynamic Accuracy Calculation:** Implement JavaScript to correctly calculate and display the overall accuracy percentage based on correct/incorrect answers logged in `postman learning.md`.
*   [ ] **Contribution Graph Data:** Integrate real activity data from `postman learning.md` into the contribution graph. This involves parsing dates and activity levels from the learning log.

## 2. Visual Enhancements & Polish

*   [ ] **Refine GitHub Dark Theme:** Fine-tune colors, spacing, and element styles to more closely match the `ai-2027.com` aesthetic (e.g., subtle glows, specific border treatments, background patterns).
*   [ ] **Code Block Styling:** Enhance `code` and `pre` block styling (e.g., optional line numbers, basic syntax highlighting if feasible without heavy libraries).
*   [ ] **Subtle Animations:** Add subtle, non-distracting animations (e.g., blinking cursor effect on certain text, subtle hover effects on clickable elements).
*   [ ] **Loading States:** (If dynamic data fetching were implemented later) Add visual indicators for loading content.

## 3. Interactivity & User Experience

*   [ ] **Collapsible Sections:** (Already implemented) Ensure smooth expand/collapse behavior and consistent styling.
*   [ ] **Navigation (Future):** If the dashboard grows, consider adding internal navigation or a table of contents.

## 4. General & Technical

*   [ ] **Responsiveness:** Ensure the dashboard looks good and functions well on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
*   [ ] **Accessibility:** Review and improve accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes).
